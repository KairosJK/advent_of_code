# 🎄 Advent of Code 

My solutions to advent of code challenges, written in rust and using cargo 🦀

## 🖳 How to run:

Select days can be run using cargo with the command:

```cargo run --bin dayXX```

where `XX` is the day, for example day 4 can be run using the command:

```cargo run --bin day04```

Further, input data can be changed by editing the `dayXX.input` file found in the `/input` directory
